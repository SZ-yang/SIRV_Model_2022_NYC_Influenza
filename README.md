# Refined SIR Model with Vaccination and its Application in 2022 NYC Influenza A Activity Prediction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of Influenza A activities over the past five years and forecast the trend for 2022 in New York. Utilizing a refined Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model that incorporates vaccination effects, I analyzed and predicted flu trends through a series of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) methods.
